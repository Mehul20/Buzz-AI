        "Name": "Global Entrepreneurship",
        "Description": "This course will provide you with real-world, hands-on learning on what it’s like to create a startup. You will learn the language and values of entrepreneurship, and then work to hone your entrepreneurial skills. This course is not about how to write a business plan, nor is it an exercise on how smart you are in a classroom, or how well you do research. Instead, it is a laboratory: you will be getting your hands dirty talking to customers, partners, competitors, as you encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a startup actually works. It is possible that you may create a startup you wish to pursue. You will learn how to turn a good idea into a great company. You’ll learn how to use a business model to brainstorm each part of a company and the customer development process to get out of the classroom to see whether anyone other than you would want/use your product. You'll participate in these discovery activities. Finally, you’ll see how agile development can help you rapidly iterate your product to build something customers will use and buy."
